                    Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must
                    be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of
                    development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication,
                    routing, sessions, and caching. Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the
                    developer without sacrificing application functionality.
